  <p>
  As a governance analyst it is part of your duties to assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach. To be successful at your job you often need to know the techniques used by hackers to circumvent implemented controls and propose uplifts to increase the overall level of security in an organization. Gaining valid credentials gives the attackers access to the organization’s IT system, thus circumventing most of perimeter controls in place.

  <br/>
 
  <h3> <i> Here is your task </i></h3>
  <p>
  
  <b>Your job is to crack as many passwords as possible with available tools (e.g. use Hashcat). Here are your Task instructions: </b> <br>
Review the links provided in the additional resources (section 4) below to gain a background understanding of password cracking
Try to crack the passwords provided in the 'password dump' file below using available tools
Assess the 5 questions in the task instructions below in relation to the passwords provided (type of hashing algorithm, level of protection, possible controls that could be implemented, password policy, changes in policy)
Draft an email/memo briefly explaining your findings in relation to controls used by the organization and your proposed uplifts. We recommend spending about 1.5 hours on this task and keeping it at 1 page in length. 
Your answer should be provided in the form of a draft email/memo explaining your findings and conclusions of controls currently used by an organization to prevent successful cracking of passwords and potential uplifts that you would propose to existing controls with justifications.

You must determine the following:
 > What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords? <br>
What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?  <br>
What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?  <br>
What can you tell about the organization’s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?   <br>
What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder?

 # Letter and report : 
 ```
 Dear Sir/Ma’am, 
 
                I found several defenselessness after trying to crack all the leaked hashes, 
                in your password policy and this email concludes all the findings and suggestions to 
                improve your password policy. Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) and Message Digest 
                (MD5) are the standard cryptographic hash functions to provide data security for 
                authentication. All the password which are compromised were using MD5 which is 
                a weaker hash algorithm and is prone to collisions. It was very easy to crack with 
                Hashcat.com and rockyou.txt wordlist via terminal and web browsers.
                
                Here I have also another website to find password: https://crackstation.net/,
                                                                   https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash,
                 
                After cracking the passwords, we find the following things about organization’s 
                password policy:
                
                   Avoid common words and character combinations in your password.
                
                   There is no specific requirement for the password creation. Users can use 
                    any combination of word and letters to create a password. You can include 
                    several new things in your password policy. My recommendations are: 
                   Longer passwords are better, 8 characters is a starting point. 
                  
                   Minimum length for password is set to 6. 
                   Don’t reuse your passwords.
                   Include special character, Capital and Small letters, numbers in your password. 
                   Don’t let users include their username, actual name, date of birth and other 
                    personal information while creating a password.
                   Train your users to follow these policies to keep their passwords safe.


          Thanking You,
